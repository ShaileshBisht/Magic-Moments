      <p>Learn how to write more effective prompts to get the best results from AI art generators and unlock your creative potential.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Be Specific and Descriptive</h2>
      <p>Instead of "a cat," try "a fluffy orange tabby cat sitting on a windowsill with sunlight streaming through lace curtains." The more specific you are, the better the AI can understand your vision.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Use Art Style References</h2>
      <p>Mention specific art styles, artists, or movements to guide the aesthetic:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"In the style of Van Gogh"</li>
        <li>"Digital art, concept art style"</li>
        <li>"Watercolor painting"</li>
        <li>"Photorealistic, studio lighting"</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>3. Include Lighting and Mood</h2>
      <p>Lighting dramatically affects the mood of your image. Be specific about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Time of day (golden hour, midnight, dawn)</li>
        <li>Light source (candlelight, neon, natural sunlight)</li>
        <li>Atmosphere (moody, bright, dramatic, soft)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>4. Specify Camera Angles and Composition</h2>
      <p>Think like a photographer or director:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Close-up portrait"</li>
        <li>"Wide-angle landscape"</li>
        <li>"Bird's eye view"</li>
        <li>"Rule of thirds composition"</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Mastering AI art prompts is an art form in itself. The key is to be descriptive, specific, and patient. With practice, you'll develop an intuition for what works and create stunning AI-generated artwork that matches your creative vision.</p>
